- ly.renderer:
Move basics to platform-specific renderers.
Game needs an own renderer that allows usage of game.status,
which is game code and shouldn't be placed inside the
ly.renderer...

- game.renderer:

to abstract typical layouting stuff like borders,
positions, relative coordinate translation etc.
(maybe like the canvas plugin in editor?)
